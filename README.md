# eventdrivenform-calculator
This project involves a simple web form that collects information from the user. The form includes labeled input fields for the user's first and last name, student ID number, and a short biography.

The form also includes a basic calculator that allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations. The calculator has a text field to display the result, and 16 buttons including the numbers 0-9, C for clearing the result field, = for performing the last operation, and +, -, /, and * for arithmetic operations.

The calculator responds dynamically to user input, allowing the user to enter a numeric value, append digits to the value, and perform arithmetic operations. If the user types non-numeric data, the text field changes to display an error message. The calculator is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
